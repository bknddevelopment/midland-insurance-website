## üö® Blockers to Watch

1. **Performance Testing**
   - If site is behind auth, use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse instead
   - Document any testing limitations

2. **Navigation Complexity**
   - If mega menu causes performance issues, consider simpler dropdown
   - Mobile menu must remain performant

3. **Schema Validation**
   - Some schemas may need adjustment for Next.js
   - Test in production-like environment

---

## üìù Daily Standup Format

Each day, update the implementation log with:
1. **Completed**: What was finished
2. **In Progress**: What's being worked on
3. **Blockers**: Any issues encountered
4. **Next**: What's planned for tomorrow
5. **Metrics**: Any performance improvements
