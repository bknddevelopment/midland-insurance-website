  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'What are typical workers\' comp rates for construction in NJ?',
      answer: 'Rates vary significantly by trade. Clerical work may be 0.5% of payroll while roofing can exceed 20%. Your specific rate depends on classification, experience mod, and claims history. We\'ll provide exact rates for your business.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can owners exclude themselves from coverage?',
      answer: 'In New Jersey, sole proprietors, partners, and LLC members can exclude themselves but must file specific forms. However, many general contractors require all individuals on site to be covered, so exclusion may limit your work opportunities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is an experience modification factor?',
      answer: 'Your "mod" compares your claims history to similar businesses. New businesses start at 1.0. Good safety records can reduce it below 1.0 (saving money), while poor records increase it above 1.0 (costing more).',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need workers\' comp for 1099 subcontractors?',
      answer: 'Generally no, but NJ strictly enforces employee classification. If the state determines your "1099s" are actually employees, you\'ll owe back premiums, penalties, and potential claims. We recommend proper classification review.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I don\'t have workers\' comp?',
      answer: 'Operating without required coverage in NJ results in stop-work orders, fines of $5,000+, personal liability for all medical costs, and potential criminal charges. It also disqualifies you from most construction contracts.',
