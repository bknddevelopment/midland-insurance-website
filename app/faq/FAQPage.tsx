        {
          question: 'What does general liability insurance cover for contractors?',
          answer: 'General liability insurance covers third-party bodily injury, property damage, and personal/advertising injury claims. This includes accidents at job sites, damage to client property, and completed operations claims. It typically covers legal defense costs, medical expenses, and settlements or judgments.',
          category: 'General Liability'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much general liability coverage do I need?',
          answer: 'Most contractors need at least $1 million per occurrence and $2 million aggregate coverage. However, many contracts require $2 million per occurrence. Large commercial projects may require $5 million or more. We help determine the right amount based on your contracts and risk exposure.',
          category: 'General Liability'
        },
        {
          question: 'Does general liability cover faulty workmanship?',
          answer: 'General liability typically excludes damage to your own work (faulty workmanship). However, it does cover resulting damage to other property. For example, if faulty plumbing causes water damage to walls, the plumbing repair isn\'t covered, but the wall damage is.',
          category: 'General Liability'
        },
        {
          question: 'Are subcontractors covered under my general liability policy?',
          answer: 'Subcontractors are typically not automatically covered. You may need to add them as additional insureds or require them to carry their own insurance. Uninsured subcontractor claims can impact your policy, so we recommend requiring certificates of insurance from all subs.',

          question: 'Is workers compensation required in New Jersey?',
          answer: 'Yes, workers compensation is required in New Jersey if you have any employees, even just one. This includes part-time and seasonal workers. Sole proprietors and partners can elect to be covered but aren\'t required. Penalties for non-compliance can be severe.',

        },
        {
          question: 'What does workers compensation insurance cover?',
          answer: 'Workers comp covers medical expenses, lost wages (typically 70% of average weekly wage), rehabilitation costs, and death benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses. It also provides employer liability coverage protecting you from employee lawsuits related to workplace injuries.',
          category: 'Workers Compensation'
        },
        {
          question: 'How are workers comp premiums calculated?',
          answer: 'Premiums are based on payroll, job classifications (class codes), and your experience modification factor (mod rate). Construction trades have different rates based on risk level. Your mod rate reflects your claims history compared to similar businesses - good safety records lower your premiums.',

        {
          question: 'Can I exclude myself from workers compensation as an owner?',
          answer: 'Yes, sole proprietors, partners, and LLC members can exclude themselves in New Jersey. Corporate officers can also elect exclusion. However, many general contractors require all individuals on site to be covered, so exclusion might limit your work opportunities.',

          question: 'Do I need commercial auto for my pickup truck?',

          category: 'Commercial Auto'
        },
        {
          question: 'What does hired and non-owned auto coverage protect?',
          answer: 'Hired auto covers vehicles you rent or lease for business. Non-owned auto covers employee vehicles used for your business. This is important if employees run errands or drive to job sites in their personal vehicles. It protects your business from liability.',

          question: 'Are tools and equipment covered in my commercial vehicle?',

          question: 'Is there a deductible for tools and equipment claims?',
          answer: 'Yes, typical deductibles range from $250 to $2,500 depending on your policy and preferences. Higher deductibles lower premiums. Some policies have separate deductibles for different types of losses (theft vs. damage). We help you choose the right balance.',

          answer: 'Insurance protects you from losses, while bonds guarantee you\'ll fulfill obligations. If a bond claim is paid, you must reimburse the surety company. Bonds are three-party agreements between you (principal), the project owner (obligee), and the surety company.',

          question: 'What should I do if an accident happens on my job site?',

It\'s commonly required in construction contracts. The coverage is typically limited to claims caused by your negligence.',
