      question: 'Do I need boat insurance in New Jersey?',
      answer: 'While New Jersey doesn\'t require boat insurance by law, many marinas require it for docking. Additionally, if you have a boat loan, your lender will require coverage. Even without these requirements, boat insurance protects your investment and provides liability coverage.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What types of boats can you insure?',
      answer: 'We insure all types of watercraft including powerboats, sailboats, fishing boats, pontoon boats, personal watercraft (jet skis), and yachts. Coverage is available for boats of all sizes and values.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Does boat insurance cover me year-round?',
      answer: 'Yes, most policies provide year-round coverage. Some insurers offer lay-up periods during winter months when your boat is in storage, which can reduce your premium while maintaining comprehensive coverage.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the difference between actual cash value and agreed value?',
      answer: 'Actual cash value pays the depreciated value of your boat at the time of loss. Agreed value coverage pays a predetermined amount you and the insurer agree upon when you buy the policy, providing better protection for your investment.'
